Read in a sentence from STDIN. The sentence is guaranteed to not have any punctuation and all letters will be lowercase. Output the words of the sentence, sorted alphabetically, in three columns.  However, words should be sorted vertically and not horizontally.  All columns should be as evenly weighted as possible (i.e., no column should have more or less than one word than any other column).Columns should be left aligned in output and be separated by at least one space.

                        For example:
                               Input: a b c d e f g h

                               b e h
                               c f
                               
                               Input: this is a github page
                               Output:
